I think I missed you callin' on the other line

I'm just thinkin' all these thoughts up in my mind

Talkin' love

But I can't even read the signs

I would sell my soul for a bit more time

You stain all on my body

Like you're red wine

You're the fuckin' acid to my alkaline

You run your middle finger up and down my spine

I'm sorry there was no one to apologize
